Windoors is a website I made with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

It includes signup/signin functionality with encrypted passwords, the ability to order windows and doors from a catalog, and the ability to see your list of orders.
It also includes admin functionality for admin users to add more items to the catalog.

This website is about 85% complete, with 10% of the remaining work being functionality such as the ability to remove items from the catalog as an admin, denying users from making an order when a product is unavailable, and the integration of the reseller User subclass. The last 5% would be polish for a smoother user experience.
